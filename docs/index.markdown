## Code of Conduct

All attendees are expected to adhere to the following code of conduct:

The expectation of this event is that all interactions are based on mutual respect. All participants are expected to engage in discussions with civility and consideration. Harassment in any form—whether verbal, physical, or implied—will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome attention, discriminatory remarks, personal attacks, or any behavior that may be deemed hostile, intimidating, or offensive. Protests, interruptions, and any actions intended to disrupt or derail the event/discussion are strictly prohibited. Disorderly, aggressive, or inappropriate behavior will result in immediate removal from the event. Participants must not engage in actions or speech that make others feel unsafe or uncomfortable. We are committed to maintaining an inclusive environment where everyone can engage without fear of exclusion or harm.

This community comprises many different perspectives and identities, and we should not expect to completely agree with each other all the time. Disagreement is natural, but it must be expressed constructively and respectfully. Listen carefully and speak kindly; we all have much to learn from one another.

Those who are not able to abide by these guidelines will be asked to leave.
